# Pattern Debug with Virtual Tester

Here is the example code from [TestInsights](http://www.testinsight.com) Tuesday Tutorial on Scan Pattern Debug Webinar.
The repository contains
* Example 93k Test Program (testprogram)
* Associated Test method library (pattern_debug_tml)
* 93kvt Setup and Verilog Test bench
* Mock DUT (asic.v)

*Note that you do need to have a Verilog simulator installed*  I have used ModelSim in this example but any other should do. I have used VT with iverilog but not tested any of the other Cadence or Mentor sims.
